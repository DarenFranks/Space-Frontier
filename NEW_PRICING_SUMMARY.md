# Space Frontier - New Pricing System

## Overview
The item value system has been completely revamped to create a proper economic hierarchy where **ships are the highest cost**, followed by modules, components, and finally raw ore as the cheapest.

## Pricing Hierarchy (Lowest to Highest)

### 1. Raw Resources (Ore) - **CHEAPEST**
- **Common** (Voltium, Titanite): 100-200 CR
- **Uncommon** (Nexium): 600 CR
- **Rare** (Chronite, Neural Fiber): 2,500-4,000 CR
- **Very Rare** (Synthcrystal, Quantum Dust): 10,000-12,000 CR
- **Legendary** (Darkwater): 30,000 CR

### 2. Refined Resources
- **1.75x - 2.2x raw cost** (due to volume reduction and refining process)
- Example: Raw Voltium 100 CR → Refined Voltium 200 CR (2x)
- Example: Raw Darkwater 30,000 CR → Darkwater Essence 65,000 CR (2.17x)

### 3. Module Components
- Built from refined resources
- Intermediate crafting materials
- Costs scale based on material requirements

### 4. Ship Modules

#### Tier 1 (Early Game - Scout/Fighter/Hauler)
- **Basic Weapons** (Pulse Cannon): 9,000 CR
- **Advanced Weapons** (Plasma Lance): 18,000 CR
- **Heavy Weapons** (Void Torpedo): 24,000 CR
- **Basic Defense** (Fortress Plating): 10,000 CR
- **Advanced Defense** (Aegis Shield): 14,000 CR
- **Special Defense** (Phantom Cloak): 24,000 CR
- **Basic Utility** (Scanner): 10,000 CR
- **Standard Utility** (Drill/Warp): 18,000 CR
- **Special Utility** (Refinery/Mfg): 30,000 CR
- **Engines** (Nova T1): 14,000 CR

#### Tier 2 (Late Game - Cruiser/Destroyer/Battleship/Carrier/Refinery)
- **Weapons** (Pulse Cannon T2): 160,000 CR
- **Defense** (Aegis Shield T2): 240,000 CR
- **Utility** (Harvester T2): 180,000 CR
- **Special Utility** (Industrial Refinery T2): 500,000 CR
- **Engines** (Nova T2): 240,000 CR

### 5. Ship Components (8 needed per ship)

Each ship requires **8 specific components** to build. Prices scale with ship tier:

- **Scout**: 2,400 CR each (19,200 total)
- **Fighter**: 4,800 CR each (38,400 total)
- **Hauler**: 8,600 CR each (68,800 total)
- **Cruiser**: 30,000 CR each (240,000 total)
- **Destroyer**: 48,000 CR each (384,000 total)
- **Battleship**: 127,000 CR each (1,016,000 total)
- **Carrier**: 134,000 CR each (1,072,000 total)
- **Refinery**: 204,000 CR each (1,632,000 total)

Components have tier multipliers:
- T1: base cost
- T2: base cost × 3
- T3: base cost × 9

### 6. Ships - **HIGHEST COST**
- **Scout**: 100,000 CR (base)
- **Fighter**: 250,000 CR
- **Hauler**: 400,000 CR
- **Cruiser**: 1,200,000 CR
- **Destroyer**: 2,500,000 CR
- **Battleship**: 6,000,000 CR
- **Carrier**: 5,000,000 CR
- **Refinery**: 8,000,000 CR

Ship costs multiply with variants (1.0x, 1.3x, 1.7x, 2.2x) and tiers (1.0x, 1.8x, 3.0x).

**Most expensive ship**: Refinery Specialized MK3 = 8M × 2.2 × 3.0 = **52,800,000 CR**

## Module Cost Ratios (Target: 50-80% of ship cost)

The module costs have been balanced so that **fully fitting a ship costs 50-80% of the ship's base cost**:

| Ship | With T1 Modules | With T2 Modules | Recommended |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Scout | 96% | - | T1 (starter ship) |
| Fighter | 38% | - | T1 (early game) |
| Hauler | 34% | - | T1 (early game) |
| Cruiser | 14% | 212% | Mix T1/T2 (mid game) |
| Destroyer | 9% | 134% | Mix T1/T2 (mid game) |
| Battleship | 5% | **75%** ✓ | T2 (late game) |
| Carrier | 6% | **86%** ✓ | T2 (late game) |
| Refinery | 3% | 42% | T2 (late game) |

**Note**: Early ships (Scout/Fighter/Hauler) use T1 modules, while late-game ships (Battleship/Carrier) use T2 modules and hit the perfect 50-80% target range.

## Key Changes

1. **Raw ore prices slightly adjusted** to maintain 1.75-2.2x refining multiplier
2. **Module prices reduced 30-60%** to better balance with ship costs
3. **Ship component prices reduced 50-80%** to represent 15-21% of ship cost
4. **Ship prices unchanged** - remain the highest cost items

## Economic Impact

- **Early game** is more affordable - T1 modules are cheaper
- **Late game** ships require significant module investment (50-80% of ship cost)
- **Manufacturing remains profitable** - components and modules maintain ~30% profit margin
- **Refining remains valuable** - 1.75x-2.2x value increase
- **Clear progression** from cheap ore → refined → components → modules → ships
